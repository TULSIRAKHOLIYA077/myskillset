    <title>Hoisting</title>

<body>
    the JavaScript engine scans the entire code for variable and function declarations and hoists them to the top of their respective scopes. This means it moves the declarations (but not the assignments) to the top. 

    Function Declarations: The entire function (including both the declaration and the definition) is hoisted to the top of its scope. This is why you can call function declarations before they appear in the code.

    // Calling the function before it is declared
    console.log(addNumbers(5, 3)); // Outputs: 8

    // Function declaration
    function addNumbers(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }


    Variable Declarations (including Function Expressions assigned to variables): Only the declaration part (e.g., var addNumbers;) is hoisted to the top of its scope, not the initialization or assignment (e.g., = function(a, b) { return a + b; };). The variable exists, but it's undefined until the execution phase reaches the point where it's actually assigned.

    // This will throw an error: TypeError: addNumbers is not a function
    console.log(addNumbers(5, 3));

    // Function expression
    var addNumbers = function(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    };
