    var: Variables declared with var are function-scoped. This means that they are accessible throughout the function in which they are declared, regardless of where within the function they are declared. Variables declared with var are also hoisted to the top of their containing function, which means they can be accessed even before they are declared.

    let: Variables declared with let are block-scoped. This means that they are accessible only within the block (i.e., within curly braces {}) in which they are declared. Unlike var, variables declared with let are not hoisted to the top of their containing block. They exist in the block only after the point of declaration.

    function exampleFunction() {
        if (true) {
            var varVariable = "I am var"; // var is function-scoped
            let letVariable = "I am let"; // let is block-scoped
        }
    
        console.log(varVariable); // Output: "I am var"
        console.log(letVariable); // ReferenceError: letVariable is not defined
    }


    Global Scope: If a variable declared with var is declared outside of any function, it will have global scope. This means it can be accessed from anywhere in the JavaScript code.


    var globalVar = "I am global"; // Global scope

    Functional Scope: If a variable declared with var is declared inside a function, it will have functional scope. This means it is accessible only within the function in which it is declared.


    function exampleFunction() {
        var functionalVar = "I am functional"; // Functional scope
    }
